# Loux_for_starveio
This is a script for the game starve.io that I've found but I have a hard time cracking it. 

I've found this script for a game called starve.io. The name of the script is Loux for starve.io I've simplified the code somehow but I can't make it work. I think it suppose to generate a key, which is what I need to get access to the script. I think the developer made a puzzle. 

*This is the link of the script: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/443853-loux-for-starve-io*

The commented base64 code in the script is "Discord: usrgnome#5536" which doesn't exist. The script is from 11 months ago. And eval('') has been used to confuse the puzzle solver but I just deleted it and then I used JS beautifier to get a better idea of what the code is, after looking at the code I got an idea what it was, I think it goes through a bunch of letters to generate the key code but I couldn't figure out how to make it work. Any ideas?
